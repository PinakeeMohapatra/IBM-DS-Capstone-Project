# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - Winning Space Race with Data Science

## Introduction

### Commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufacturer aims to make access to space cheaper and more reliable through reusable launch vehicles sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. The reason why SpaceX become one of the top in this industry is because SpaceX rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertised Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollar each and much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of their rocket.

### Since the rocket cost highly depends on the successful rate of reuse of the first stage of racket. Having these concerns in mind, I have basically narrowed it all down to a single question: Can we find out the best parameters in the first stage to ensure the successful landing rate of our First Stage rocket, So that we can able to determine the best cost for the rocket launch. Also, find out how the parameters in the first stage affect on the successful landing rate of Falcon 9.

### The first goal is to determine the price of each launch. This is done by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for the team. Also, determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

### Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land Successfully or Not, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
